After some health issues, I started reading and learning more about nutrition.  Trying to get my diet in check, and stop eating junk. My blood pressure and cholesterol was simply too high. I started tracking what I ate and my sodium was through the roof. Some of what I was eating had trans fat, and most of it was processed.    

I looked to the internet, books, and friends.  The answer was one I didn’t want to hear.  You need real food.  The kind near the front of the store.  The kind without labels. The kind you have to pay extra for and put in work to prepare. 

What was offered at the grocery store didn’t look that appealing to me.  It looked sad.  Picked days or weeks ago, packed in a bag, and shipped hundreds of miles.  These vegetables were a shell of their former selves. After four books, several tools, and some back breaking work, I was the proud owner of a small square garden.

Frustration was high, production was low, but pride was through the roof.  I was growing my own food.  Even if it was just two or three salads some months and some bagged beans for the freezer.  

I had several issues with traditional gardening though in the form of bugs, bad soil, and low production. I moved to container gardening and it solved many problems that I had for a variety of vegetables. I decided to start blogging about it so that others could help me along the way. And maybe, just maybe, someone would read about my mistakes and learn from it.
