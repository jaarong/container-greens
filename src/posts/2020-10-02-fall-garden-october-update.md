As you can see in the photo, everything is not going as planned with my fall garden. The temperatures have really changed in the past month. With the first two weeks after planting being very hot with temperatures in the low 90's. The last two weeks have been mild, even relatively cold for September in the 70's and 80's. 

The “Ruby Red” Swiss Chard, which is on the left bottom of the photo, is hardly growing at all. This is one of my staples in the past, growing in almost any temperature. I think I'm going to give it another week, and then restart if nothing is still happening. 

The “Esmee” Arugula (top left), another vegetable that I thought may do ok in the hot temperatures, is also struggling. It also gets a reprieve for another week, especially since the germination was fairly good.

The mizuna (top right), may be doing the best out of the four with good germination and ok growth. I may be harvesting and eating some of it in the next two weeks to add to my salads. 

Finally, the Bush Champion Zucchini has good growth and has started flowering in the past two weeks. Based on other plants I have in my garden, the problem I think I am going to have there is pollination. All the pollinators seem to have left my garden with the exception of a few late bloomers. No bees in sight and only two or three butterflies that never make it to my deck. 

But such is the joy of gardening. I'll pull out more seed packets over the next week and get started experimenting with some other varieties in the milder weather. Hopefully with better results.
