Gardening podcasts for the purposes of growing vegetables are a bit hard to find since a lot of podcasts focus more on the larger garden including trees, flowers, shrubs, and animals. The list I've created are the podcasts that I listen to that at least for the majority of the episodes focus on vegetable gardening. I've created a list of my favorites over at podchaser.com. Check them out:
